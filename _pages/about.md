I am a Senior Algorithm Engineer at (DuerOS)[https://dueros.baidu.com/] of (Baidu Group)[https://www.baidu.com/]. I obtained my B.S. in information and communication engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019 and bachelor degree in communication engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology(WHUT) in 2016.

I have broad interests in computer vision and AI. My current major work topics are about: 
* Person ReID
* Face recognition, Landmark, Face Image Quality(FQA), Face Attribute(Age, Gender, e.g.)
* Gesture recognition(image-based and skeleton-based) 
* Action recognition(skeleton-based) 
* Generative art

I am passionate about AI and technology. As an AI feature owner in company, I have enabled tens of millions of intelligent IoT devices, including smart screens, smart tablets, fitness mirrors and smart TVs. My pleasure is to better assist, enhance, protect and entertain users lives through cutting-edge AI technologies. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvWIDdO0Hmo)

My future research interest lies in combining artificial intelligence and creativity in the arts. I look forward to creating works that are more thoughtful and inspiring to the public through the interactive inspiration of Big Data and human creativity.
