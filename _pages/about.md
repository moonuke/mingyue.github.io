I am a Senior Algorithm Engineer at [DuerOS](https://dueros.baidu.com/) of [Baidu Group](https://www.baidu.com/). I obtained my B.S. in information and communication engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019 and B.Sc. in communication engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology (WHUT) in 2016.

I have broad interests in computer vision and AI. My current major work topics are about: 
* Person re-identification
* Face recognition, landmark, Face image quality (FQA), Face attributes (Age, Gender, e.g.)
* Gesture recognition (Image-based and Skeleton-based) 
* Action recognition (Skeleton-based) 
* Generative art

I am passionate about AI and technology. As an AI feature owner in company, I have enabled tens of millions of intelligent IoT devices, including smart screens, smart tablets, fitness mirrors and smart TVs. My pleasure is to better assist, enhance, protect and entertain users lives through cutting-edge AI technologies. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvWIDdO0Hmo)

My future research interest lies in combining artificial intelligence and creativity in the arts. I look forward to creating works that are more thoughtful and inspiring to the public through the interactive inspiration of Big Data and human creativity.

Projects and Research
======
### FaceID 
FaceID project include face recognition, landmark, face quality (FQA), face attributes(age, gender, e.g.) technologies. Applied to the product, those lightweight and high-performance models run on Android devices in real time and provide support for child protection, personal privacy protection, elderly assistance, face payment, security monitoring and entertainment effects for users.

### Face Generation Animation
Face generation animation project is an advanced combination of current AR face technologies. First, this feature detects and tracks facial expressions, then based on the joint effect of real faces and generated 2.5D anime faces, this application allowing users to simulate animation images in real time.

### Gesture Recognition
Gesture recognition is a computing process that attempts to recognize and interpret human gestures through the use of machine learning algorithms. Our gesture recognition technology that is vision based uses a camera or 2D hand keypoints to track user movements and translate them in real time. Gesture recognition is an important interface for next-generation interactive control.

### Action Recognition
Action recognition project is based on 2D skeleton representations of human bodies. First, it recognizes the motor behavior of users, then analyzes the correctness of the exercise, eventually provides fitness and dance advice on our AI fitness mirror.

### Human Body Analysis: Person Re-identification
Person re-identification(ReID) is the task of associating images of the same person taken from different cameras or from the same camera in different occasions. Our algorithm has provided support for photo album clustering and criminal investigation trajectory analysis. In the future, it can also provide AI power for the realization of the tracking of people and things in the “Metaverse”.
