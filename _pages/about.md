I am a Senior Algorithm Engineer at [DuerOS](https://dueros.baidu.com/) of [Baidu Group](https://www.baidu.com/). I obtained my B.S. in information and communication engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019 and B.Sc. in communication engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology (WHUT) in 2016.

I have extensive and professional experiences in AI development and implementation, and my current major work topics in computer vision and AI are about: 
* Person re-identification
* Face recognition, landmark, Face image quality (FQA), Face attributes (Age, Gender, e.g.)
* Gesture recognition (Image-based and Skeleton-based) 
* Action recognition (Skeleton-based) 
* Generative art

I am passionate about AI and technology. As an AI-feature owner in company, I have successfully used it to solve many difficult practical problems. Furthermore, I have enabled tens of millions of intelligent IoT devices, including smart screens, smart tablets, fitness mirrors and smart TVs. My pleasure is to better assist, enhance, protect and entertain users lives through cutting-edge AI technologies in Baidu. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvWIDdO0Hmo)

I think the following characteristics of mine have played a very positive role in the process of commercializing the algorithms:
* Having good development habits: establishing a standardized R&D process system within our group, and improving the efficiency of the engineering.
* Having solid coding ability: establishing and maintaining the code structure of all the AI-algorithms in the group, and productize them with SDK.
* Having professional basic algorithm skills, improving algorithms performance with various ablation experiments.
* Having a forward-looking vision: utilizing cutting-edge algorithms for products from the user's point of view.
* Thinking independently and solving difficulties in business: finding badcases in practical problems and optimizing them.

My future research interest lies in combining artificial intelligence and creativity in the arts. Appropriately, I believe that my extensive research and specialized engineering capabilities can help a lot, and it will serve as a solid foundation and a powerful engine for my cutting-edge researches in this new field. Definitely, I am really looking forward to contribute to the following three impacts in the future: 
* From technical perspective, Making better and more pervasive AI-technologies for the public: improving algorithms performance and reducing barriers to art and creativity.
* For better application, Using AI-technology as an engine, building new tools to engage with human.
* For the sake of innovating the form of artistic expression，Exploring new art and combinations: ideally serving to educate and inspire people with regards to the beauty of art.

Projects and Research
======
### FaceID 
FaceID project include face recognition, landmark, face quality (FQA), face attributes(age, gender, e.g.) technologies. Applied to the product, those lightweight and high-performance models run on Android devices in real time and provide support for child protection, personal privacy protection, elderly assistance, face payment, security monitoring and entertainment effects for users.

### Face Generation Animation
Face generation animation project is an advanced combination of current AR face technologies. First, this feature detects and tracks facial expressions, then based on the joint effect of real faces and generated 2.5D anime faces, this application allowing users to simulate animation images in real time.

### Gesture Recognition
Gesture recognition is a computing process that attempts to recognize and interpret human gestures through the use of machine learning algorithms. Our gesture recognition technology that is vision based uses a camera or 2D hand keypoints to track user movements and translate them in real time. Gesture recognition is an important interface for next-generation interactive control.

### Action Recognition
Action recognition project is based on 2D skeleton representations of human bodies. First, it recognizes the motor behavior of users, then analyzes the correctness of the exercise, eventually provides fitness and dance advice on our AI fitness mirror.

### Human Body Analysis: Person Re-identification
Person re-identification(ReID) is the task of associating images of the same person taken from different cameras or from the same camera in different occasions. Our algorithm has provided support for photo album clustering and criminal investigation trajectory analysis. In the future, it can also provide AI power for the realization of the tracking of people and things in the “Metaverse”.
