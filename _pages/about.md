I am a Senior Research&Develop Engineer at [DuerOS](https://dueros.baidu.com/en/index.html) of [Baidu Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu). I obtained my B.S. in information and communication engineering from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019 and B.Sc. in communication engineering from the [Wuhan University of Technology (WHUT)](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in 2016.

With professional experience in the development and optimization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in products, especially Computer Vision (CV), and my research interests are multimodal human behaviour analytics, human-AI interaction and AI explainability.
My Vision
======

I am always being committed to friendly and pervasively integrating AI technology into people's daily life. For instance, in Baidu, I have successfully promoted in assisting, enhancing, protecting and entertaining users lives through cutting-edge AI technologies, through enabling tens of millions of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart screens, Pads, fitness mirrors and TVs.

Recently, I have pivoted to the intersection of multimodal AI and human enhancement, aiming to facilitate human-AI collaborative applications for personalized creation and behavioral assistance needs. Specifically, after laying enough groundwork, combining "bottom-up" engineering thinking and "top-down" design thinking, my vision for the future includes:


* From the perspective of technique, improve algorithms performance and reduce barriers of creativity and use.
* From the perspective of application, leverage AI-based technology as an engine, build new tools to engage with human, and improve transparency, visualization, and explainability.
* From the perspective of personalized expression, explore multimodal combinations: ideally serve to educate and inspire people.



Projects and Research
======
### Read at your fingertips in textbooks

"Read at your fingertips in textbooks" is an application, which can real-time dynamic detection and recognition of the Chinese/English words pointed by the user's finger. Output the interpretation and pronunciation of the corresponding words. Support fingertip search of words/ sentences/ assignments/ textbooks. The application using “edge-AI+cloud-AI” technical solutions, provides “image+text” multimodal retrieval technology.

### Action Recognition

Action recognition AI Feature is based on 2D key bone points representations of the human body, which provides precise analysis of a user’s physical movements during various exercises on our AI fitness mirror.

### Gesture AI Control System
Gesture AI control system uses human hands as interface, and provides real-time gesture command and global gesture interaction control. Our technology is vision based, using an image or 2D hand keypoints to track user movements and analyze them in real time. Gesture is an important interface for next-generation interactive control.

### FaceID 

FaceID AI Feature includes face recognition, landmark, FQA, face attributes (age, gender, anti-sproofing, e.g.) technologies. Applied to the product, those lightweight and high-performance models run on Android devices in real time and provide explicitly/implicitly support for child protection, personal privacy protection, elderly assistance, face payment, security monitoring and entertainment effects for users.

### Face Generation Animation

Face generation animation is an advanced combination of current AR face technologies. Based on the joint effect of real faces and generated 2.5D anime faces, this application allowing users to simulate animation images in real time.

### Human Body Analysis: Person Re-identification

Person re-identification (ReID) is the task of associating images of the same person taken from different cameras or from the same camera in different occasions. Our AI algorithm has provided support for photo album clustering and human trajectory analysis. In the future, it can also provide AI power for the realization of the tracking of people and things in the “Metaverse”.
