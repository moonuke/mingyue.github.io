I am a Senior Algorithm Engineer at [DuerOS](https://dueros.baidu.com/) of [Baidu Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu). I obtained my B.S. in information and communication engineering from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019 and B.Sc. in communication engineering from the [Wuhan University of Technology (WHUT)](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) in 2016.

With professional experience in the development and optimization of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especiallhy Computer Vision (CV), I am currently working on topics including: 
* Person Re-ID (Re-Idification)
* Face Recognition, Landmark, Face Image Quality (FQA), Face Attributes (Age, Gender, etc.)
* Gesture Recognition (Image-based and Skeleton-based) 
* Action Recognition (Skeleton-based) 
* Generative Art

-------------------------My Vision---------------------------------


I am always being committed to friendly and pervasively integrating AI technology into people's daily life. For instance, in Baidu, I have successfully promoted in assisting, enhancing, protecting and entertaining users lives through cutting-edge AI technologies, through enabling tens of millions of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart screens, smart tablets, fitness mirrors and smart TVs.

Recently, I have pivoted to the intersection of Art and AI, aiming to facilitate human-AI collaborative applications for creative and design needs. Specifically, after laying enough groundwork, combining "bottom-up" engineering thinking and "top-down" design thinking, my vision for the future Art+AI includes:


* 1. From the perspective of technique,improving algorithms performance and reducing barriers to art and creativity.
* 2. From the perspective of application, leveraging AI-based technology as an engine, and building new tools to engage with human.
* 3. From the perspective of artistic expression, exploring new art and combinations: ideally serving to educate and inspire people with regards to the beauty of art.

Projects and Research
======
### FaceID 
FaceID project include face recognition, landmark, face quality (FQA), face attributes(age, gender, e.g.) technologies. Applied to the product, those lightweight and high-performance models run on Android devices in real time and provide support for child protection, personal privacy protection, elderly assistance, face payment, security monitoring and entertainment effects for users.

### Face Generation Animation
Face generation animation project is an advanced combination of current AR face technologies. First, this feature detects and tracks facial expressions, then based on the joint effect of real faces and generated 2.5D anime faces, this application allowing users to simulate animation images in real time.

### Gesture Recognition
Gesture recognition is a computing process that attempts to recognize and interpret human gestures through the use of machine learning algorithms. Our gesture recognition technology that is vision based uses a camera or 2D hand keypoints to track user movements and translate them in real time. Gesture recognition is an important interface for next-generation interactive control.

### Action Recognition
Action recognition project is based on 2D skeleton representations of human bodies. First, it recognizes the motor behavior of users, then analyzes the correctness of the exercise, eventually provides fitness and dance advice on our AI fitness mirror.

### Human Body Analysis: Person Re-identification
Person re-identification(ReID) is the task of associating images of the same person taken from different cameras or from the same camera in different occasions. Our algorithm has provided support for photo album clustering and criminal investigation trajectory analysis. In the future, it can also provide AI power for the realization of the tracking of people and things in the “Metaverse”.
